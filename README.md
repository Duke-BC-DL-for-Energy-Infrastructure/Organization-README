# Overview

## Purpose
This repo is an overview of how to use all of this organization's repos and the steps to take to create experiments with synthetic data similar to what we have done. Each repo is meant for a different step in this process so it's important to know which one to use for which step and the general workflow for creating these experiments.

## Using this repo
Make sure to **read about the team's work at our [website](https://duke-bc-dl-for-energy-infrastructure.github.io/)**. This should give you a good sense of our methodology and what experiments we performed to test the utility of synthetic data. Then, just read the following steps for the workflow and then hopefully you can follow along in the process.

## Workflow
1. First we need some real images of the target energy infrastructure.
